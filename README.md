**How does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?** 



**Background information:**


Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company in Chicago whose marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

The director of Marketing, Lily Moreno, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members.Through the analysis of Bike Sharing data, Cyclistic aims to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. This would help them design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. 


**Business Task:**


Understanding and identifying differences between casual riders and annual members in Cyclistic bike usage. These insights would then help to enhance the marketing strategies in converting casual riders to annual members. 

**Business Objectives:**


Understanding and answering these 3 questions through data analysis 


1) How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?


2) Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?


3) How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
